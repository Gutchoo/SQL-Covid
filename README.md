This repository contains the original dataset sourced from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths, along with two derived datasets that have been segmented into vaccination data and death data.  I used Excel to clean the data by replacing empty cells with NULL and adjusting the date format to meet the requirements of the MySQL import wizard. Additionally, I utilized PopSQL to explore the dataset and gain insights into vaccination and mortality rates worldwide.
